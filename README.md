# dotfiles
Hey! You found my dotfiles!

## Linking
It would be wisest to just symlink the important files instead of copying them. At some point I will make a script that does this. For now:

```bash
ln -s dotfiles/vimrc .vimrc
ln -s dotfiles/gvimrc .gvimrc
ln -s dotfiles/tmux.conf .tmux.conf
ln -s dotfiles/vim .vim
```
