# dotfiles
Hey! You found my dotfiles!

## Linking
It would be wisest to just symlink the important files instead of copying them. At some point I will make a script that does this. For now:

```bash
cp zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -s gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
ln -s tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
ln -s vim ~/.vim
ln -s vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
